Its P/E ratio and ROE are high, indicating strong profitability and potential for future growth. The strong cash flow indicates the company has the ability to invest in its business and reward shareholders. The company's balance sheet shows strong financial health with high total assets and moderate liabilities. Given these factors, I believe AAPL is a strong buy. The company's impressive financial performance and strong cash flow position it for future growth and dividend payments. The high P/E ratio indicates the market's confidence in the company's future growth potential. I believe the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects make it a strong buy.\n"
